Newspapers have their own importance in the world. Newspaper publishing companies have now built applications or websites that allow users all over the world to access them. Current events and general knowledge can be learned by reading instructive articles in newspapers on a daily basis. There are a number of popular English newspapers published in India. Some of them are The Hindu, Hindustan Times, The Indian Express and The Times of India. Each newspaper has a different style of presentation though they speak about the same events/happenings from around the world.

Now, what interests a person; why do they read newspapers? There are people who feel their morning tea/coffee is incomplete without a newspaper. In addition to all the news from around the world, a newspaper also includes a variety of puzzles, comics and riddles. Supplements with such miscellaneous articles, stories and puzzles interest many. There are also supplements which focus solely on the economic developments, opportunities for work and study, what’s new in cinema and so on. Youngsters and kids seem to love these more than the main newspaper.

What most of us don’t really think about is the time and effort put into publishing a newspaper every single day. It is due to the relentless work of writers, journalists, news reporters, editors and the printing presses that we have been able to receive newspapers first thing in the morning, without fail.
