Fifty-seven labourers from the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) were trapped under an avalanche near the border village of Mana in Uttarakhand’s 
Chamoli district on Friday (February 28, 2025) officials said. The BRO is a road construction executive force that provides support to and is a part of the Indian Armed Forces. 
16 of 57 workers trapped under avalanche in Chamoli have been rescued: Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami.
The construction workers of the Border Roads Organisation camp were engaged in work on the border area of Mana village in Badrinath, officials said.
Personnel from ITBP and the Army are engaged in the rescue operation, Uttarakhand Chief minster Pushkar Singh Dhami said.
Chamoli DM Sandeep Tiwari said, "Information about an avalanche has been received. Around 57 labourers of BRO (Border Roads Organisation), who undertake
 snow-clearing operations, had camped there. Our teams have been mobilised - ITBP, SDRF and Administration. There is active rainfall and snowfall activities there.
"So, we are unable to deploy heli-services. Movement is difficult. Since satellite phones and other such equipment are not available there, we have not been able to have a clear communication with them. But we have not received any official information of any casualty...We are receiving full support from higher authorities. We hope that our team will reach there and rescue them safely," he added further.
Earlier on Thursday, the Lahaul and Spiti Police issued an avalanche alert for the region on February 28.
As per the press release, the advisory warned travellers and locals to exercise caution and restrict movement to designated safe routes, as medium-size avalanche triggering is possible on certain extreme slopes.
"According to the DGRE and HPSDMA, there is a snow avalanche warning (Danger Level 3, Orange) in District Lahaul and Spiti up to 28th February 2025 (1700 hrs. IST) (enclosed). According to the advisory, medium-size avalanche triggering is 
possible on few extreme slopes and restriction of movement to only safe routes is advised", the release read. 
It is actively raining and snowing therefore, we are unable to deploy heli-services. Movement is difficult," the Chamoli District Magistrate Sandeep Tiwari said.

A State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) team has left Joshimath. The army has been contacted to clear the route in Lambagad, which is currently impassable due to road blockage. Another team is on alert at Sahastradhara helipad.
 As soon as the weather conditions improve, the high-altitude rescue team of SDRF will be dropped by helicopter at the nearest place.
The SDRF drone team is also ready. However, due to heavy snowfall, drone operations are impossible right now, informed Ridhim Agarwal, Inspector General of Police, SDRF.
Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said he is "saddened" by the incident and assured that relief and rescue operations are underway.. He wrote, "I pray to Lord Badri Vishal for the safety of all the labour brothers."

Champions Trophy 2025: Apart from Pakistan's poor display, one incident that was much talked about was Abrar Ahmed's 
send-off to Shubman Gill

The India vs Pakistan Champions Trophy 2025 clash was a rather one-sided affair with the Rohit Sharma-led side dominating on all fronts. Pakistan famed bowling line-up of Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf and others could net step up while the likes of Babar Azam disappointed with the batting. Apart from their poor display, one incident that was much talked about was Abrar Ahmed's send-off to 
Shubman Gill. It happened when the spinner bowled Shubman Gill and then gave a send-off which soon became viral. 
No words were said but as Shubman Gill looked back, Ahmed indicated him to get going. The act did not impress Pakistan pace great Wasim Akram. 
I was impressed with the ball, but I wasn't with the celebration. Time aur jagah hoti hai yaar. Jeet rahe ho, thik hai celebrate kar lo. Lekin pata hai, phanse hue hain, wicket mil gayi hai. Be humble, be humble. But that's not happening. Isko bataane waala koi nahin hai. (This doesn't even look nice on tv. 
(There is a time and place. If you are winning and celebrating, there's no harm. But you know, we are struggling in the game. You have to be humble.
But that's not happening and no one is there to tell him. It doesn't even look nice and tv)"
Wasim Akram said Sports Central.
If I was there, or Waqar.It was such a nice ball and then the celebration killed that all.In two matches so far, top-ranked ODI batter Gill shone by making an unbeaten 101 and 46 in India's successful chases against Bangladesh and Pakistan respectively. On Sunday, Gill wowed everyone with his regal front-foot straight drive fetching him a boundary off Shaheen Shah Afridi.
Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com“Look, see, nothing grows under a banyan tree. And the banyan tree of Indian cricket is basically Rohit Sharma and with him, Virat Kohli. But when you look at Shubman Gill, those two straight drives, even the blistering cover drive, this is like a blitzkrieg where the opposition is taken aback, you know, it's awe-inspiring. This man has emerged from the shadows of that banyan tree and has come of age.
It's tough to say that. You rate ability in men by what they finish with, not by what they attempt. When you actually take your side through after scoring a 100 and don't throw your wicket, that responsibility is making you better. It is developing you; it's not ruining you. So, every responsibility that he's shouldered has made him better,” said Sidhu on JioHotstar.
